# Problem Solving
### a collection of solutions to interview questions

I like to stay "fresh" so to say, there I try to solve little interview questions I stumble across on the internet. The solutions I post are most certainly not the best possible solutions, but this is my take on how to solve a problem I see, if I were in an interview.

Please feel free to comment and tear my solutions apart, I appreciate your feedback.

Thanks!
